Goodbye

<br>
I'm writing this as i'm sitting here at O'hare - quite possibly for the last time ever. I'm not sure how to feel right now because my emotions are all over the place. Goodbyes are never easy but it is one that i've become accustomed to. I've said so many of those in my life that I've learned to scrape the emotions out of it and coat it with a nice thick layer of raionality. That's the coping mechanism that evolution installed in me and quite frankly it served me well so far. 

Sitting here for the last time feels realy weird, the fact that I may never eat another fat sandwhich or that I'll never be able to get amazon prime now delivered to my door step at 11 PM is quite depressing. There are so many things that first-world folks take for granted. Running hot water at all times of the day is one of them. Even the most priviledged Indian kids have to turn on a geyser and wait 15 minutes before they cann take a shower.

America has been a fascinating journey. The past five years have been a rollercoaster of a ride to say the least.This country shattered all expectations I had before moving here. Not one assumption I had about this country was true. Some of it for the better, while some not so much. One thing is for sure is that no other country in the world can deliver what America did.
