My name is Zoheb Salam. I'm an Economics and Psychology graduate turned web developer. Currently work for Wells Fargo, USA as a QA analyst. Starting August'2017 I will be moving to Lund University, Sweden to pursue an Msc. Entrepreneurship and Innovation. <br/>
<br/>
I'm also a football enthusiast, gym rat and an armchair expert on race/culture. When i'm not watching soccer, working out or coding you can find me on the hunt for spicy food. Welcome to my blog, These are all my thoughts put down in a hurry so please excuse my grammar, coherance and language. I consider myself to be a straight talker with no PC bullshit so read at your own risk!
