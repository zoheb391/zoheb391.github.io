<br/>
If you told me 2 years ago that I would start writing a blog, I'd call you crazy. It's funny how everything you are can change in an insignificant amount of time. Over the past few months, I've come to realise that lately I've been consumed by this overwhelming urge to start a blog and force my opinion into other aimless browsers of the internet. So that urge has lead me to this point right here. Welcome to my blog.

Luckily for me, after completing a 5 month web-dev bootcamp, I feel like I have the necessary skills to make my blog atleast be aesthetically pleasing if boring to read. That played a huge part in me taking an effort to start this or else I don't see how I could have mustered the enthusiasm to get this going.  

For those of you who know me and are confused on what I'll be writing about -you're guess is as good as mine. I have absolutely no idea where I'm going with this but I think that stays in line with the theme of my life. Trust me, when you've moved something like 15 times in 4 years you really start to wonder what the *&^% you're doing with your life. I've also decided to keep this blog free of expletives incase my mom some how stumbles upon it. 

Okay so as a general rule, expect the blog to touch upon these topics. It's not set in stone though. 

1. ### Chelsea FC.
She's been with me through thick and thin for the last 12 years. And after this disastrous season I probably will have plenty to write about. 

2. ### Sweden
For those of you who don't know, I received a scholarship to study at Lund University in Sweden. I'll be doing an Msc.entrepreneurship course starting this fall. I've also always wanted to live in Scandinavia for the last few years so expect plenty of material on this new adventure that I will be undertaking in a few months.

3. ### Politics
This is a difficult one because people can be too touchy but after the current reality show of an election year, I can't not write about this. Luckily, my blog doesn't have a commment section so atleast I won't have whiny butt-hurts complaining on my posts.  

4. ### Workouts 
For the last three years, the gym has taken over my life so I feel like it should have a part to play on this blog. However, I don't see how I can write much on the topic since I'm no expert but hopefully I can dissemminate some bro science and inspire one of you to pick up the iron. 

5. ### Tech Journey
As evident with this blog, I've begun treading on a new path for myself. I never imagined in my wildest dreams that I would be a programmer after graduation but it seems like that might be a reality soon. Expect this blog to be a shout out platform for some of my projects or simply how I got through some mind numbing errors.

That should be about it. I know it's going to be hard but I hope you stick with me through this.
